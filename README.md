cuipp-remote-controller
=======================


**cuipp-remote-controller** is a *express.js* -based web application which can remotely control a *Cisco Unified IP Phone*. It does so by issuing commands through *node-cuipp* whenever the user requests a key push via the web interface.


This is unfinished right now; the goal of the project is to have a web application capable of keeping track of IP phones, adding, probing capabilities and displaying a different web interface based on the phone's model number (via a bit of clever CSS).
